Real-Time Data Processing System for Weather Monitoring with Rollups and Aggregates
Project Overview
This project focuses on creating a real-time data processing system designed for weather monitoring, with the ability to generate rollups and aggregates for efficient reporting and analysis. It provides a scalable solution that collects weather data, processes it in real-time, and generates summarized metrics like averages, maximums, minimums, and other useful aggregates over different time intervals (hourly, daily, weekly, etc.).

Features
Real-Time Data Collection: Weather data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation are captured from multiple sensors in real time.
Data Rollups & Aggregates: Summarized metrics (e.g., average temperature, maximum wind speed) are generated for various time intervals (e.g., hourly, daily, weekly).
Stream Processing: Implements a stream processing pipeline using tools like Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ to handle data ingestion.
Scalable Architecture: Built to scale with increased data input, ensuring consistent performance across large datasets and sensor inputs.
Efficient Storage: Time-series databases like InfluxDB or Cassandra are used to store weather data efficiently.
Visualization: Provides a simple dashboard to visualize real-time data and historical rollups using tools like Grafana.
System Architecture
Data Ingestion Layer: Sensors send weather data to the system via a real-time data stream using a messaging queue system like Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ.

Stream Processing: The data is processed in real-time using tools such as Apache Flink or Apache Spark. It computes real-time rollups and aggregates.

Data Storage: Weather data and aggregate results are stored in a time-series database (e.g., InfluxDB, Cassandra) for efficient querying.

API & Frontend: A RESTful API serves the processed data and rollups to clients. The web-based frontend (using React or Angular) displays the real-time and historical weather data for visualization.

Key Components
Apache Kafka (or RabbitMQ): Used as the data stream platform to handle real-time ingestion of weather data from various sources.
Apache Flink / Apache Spark: Real-time stream processing tools used for performing rollups and aggregate computations.
Time-Series Database (InfluxDB / Cassandra): For storing high-volume time-stamped weather data efficiently.
Grafana / Custom Dashboard: For real-time and historical data visualization through interactive charts and graphs.
Python / Java: Backend programming to implement the data ingestion, processing, and aggregation logic.
Example Use Cases
Weather Station Monitoring: Real-time data processing from weather stations spread across multiple locations.
Environmental Analytics: Providing rollups for environmental studies based on long-term data, including weekly or monthly averages of temperatures or humidity levels.
Disaster Forecasting: Providing early alerts based on rapid changes in weather metrics like wind speed or pressure levels.
Installation and Setup
Prerequisites
Python 3.8+ / Java (for backend processing)
Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ
Apache Flink or Apache Spark
Time-Series Database (InfluxDB / Cassandra)
Grafana (optional for visualization)
Steps
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Real-Time-Weather-Monitoring.git
Install dependencies:

For Python:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
For Java, follow appropriate setup based on the processing tool (e.g., Flink, Spark).
Set up Kafka/RabbitMQ for real-time streaming:

Follow the installation guide for Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ.
Configure the Database:

Set up InfluxDB or Cassandra by following their installation documentation.
Run the Stream Processor:

For Apache Flink:
bash
Copy code
flink run -c com.project.WeatherProcessor /path/to/weather-processing.jar
For Apache Spark:
bash
Copy code
spark-submit --class com.project.WeatherProcessor /path/to/weather-processing.jar
Start the Frontend Server for Visualization:

If using Grafana, configure it to fetch data from the time-series database.
If using a custom dashboard (React/Angular), run:
bash
Copy code
npm install
npm start
